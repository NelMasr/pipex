A heretic called upon an unearthly light, and chaos ensued.
Demons crawled from the black depths.
Death upon death. Nothing but death in this barren land.
Who can we pray to?
There are only demons and fiends here.
A voice in the dark beguiles me,
'Truth is a mystery, unravelled by the candle's flames.'
From the journal of a man who wandered into another world
